## Web Application: HouseTrap Free Zone 

This is a basic and different version of the Capstone project. It is an educational website application for aspiring real estate investors who want to know the best way to learn how to invest in real estate without getting scammed. 

EXTERNAL SOURCE: I have chosen OpenLibrary.org as the source to use. There are numerous books in the real estate investment niche.

## Development Process

To get started on the frontend I installed:
Vite: npm create vite@latest .
Axios: npm i axios
React Router: npm i react-router-dom


## Errors
