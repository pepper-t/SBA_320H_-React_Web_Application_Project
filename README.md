## Web Application: HouseTrap Free Zone 

This is a basic and different version of the Capstone project. It is an educational website application for aspiring real estate investors who want to know the best way to learn how to invest in real estate without getting scammed. 

EXTERNAL SOURCE: I have chosen OpenLibrary.org as the source to use. There are numerous books in the real estate investment niche.

## Development Process

To get started on the frontend I installed:
Vite: npm create vite@latest .
Axios: npm i axios
React Router: npm i react-router-dom //I realize I no longer needed a Router

I updated the App.jsx to reflect that the url is a free public api url without an api key.

The React Hooks: I used useState and useEffects


## Errors

http://localhost:5173 is blank

I added the Open Library api code to App.jsx

I also watched a YouTube Video: "Book Search App With Open Library Search API Using React JS | React JS Project For Beginners" - GeekProbin

to get a better understanding of how to integrate the Open Library api url into my code.
